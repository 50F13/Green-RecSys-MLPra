Sustainable Recommender Systems: Optimizing Dataset Size for Energy-Efficient Algorithm Performance

This repository contains the python codes which were used to conduct recommender systems experiments and trainings on 4 datasets, each datasets 10 portions (from 10% to 100%, but only the code for one portion is uploaded in this repository and for different portions the value could be changed simply with no change in other parts of the code) and 11 different recommender algorithms.
